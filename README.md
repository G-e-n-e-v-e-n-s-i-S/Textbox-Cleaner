Download many renders of the same frame, but with different text. (A different card from the same gallery using the same frame, or the same card in a different language.)
Select the folder containing the renders.

Define which color the text you want to remove is.
If the card contains text of both colors, just run the program twice.

Decide where the final image will be saved.
This will overwrite any image at that location.

Hit the "Clean Textboxes" button.
